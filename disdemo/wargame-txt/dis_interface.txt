   #Broadcast vs Multicast: choose one to define based on needs.

   #broadcast <broadcast-IP-address>
   #Defining a broadcast will cause packets to be sent to all hosts connected to the network.
   #Broadcasts are typically made up with the first six numbers of your IP following a mask.
   #Ex: broadcast 192.168.255.255 ---> Ip:192.168.1.4 and Mask:255.255.0.0
   
   broadcast 172.17.255.255

   #multicast <multicast-IP-address> <interface-address>
   #Defining a multicast will insure packets are sent to only intended recipients.
   #multicast-ip-address: An address in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.
   #interface-address: The first six digit of your machine s IP address.
   #Ex: multicast 224.0.0.0 192.168
   
   #port <ip-port-number>
   #A communication endpoint for computers on a network. choose a number between 1024 and 65535
   #Ports from 0 to 1023 are usually reserved for privileged services and should be avoided.
   #Ex:
   port 7654
   
   #send_port <IP-port-number>
   #receive_port <IP-port-number>
   #The ports in which you send and recieve data can be specified seperately. 
   #Choose two port numbers between 1024 and 65535
   
   #force <side> <dis-force-id>
   #Specify the DIS force identifier that corresponds to a WSF platform side. 
   #This command should be specified for each side that is present in the scenario.
   #Ex:
   force blue   1
   force red    2
   force green  3
   force purple 4
   
   #entity_type <platform_type> <dis-entity-type>
   #Specify the DIS entity type to be used when sending PDUs for platforms or munitions 
   #with the indicated WSF platform type. This command should be specified for each
   #WSF platform type that is present in the scenario. If the type of a platform does 
   #not have a corresponding DIS entity type then 0:0:0:0:0:0:0 will be used. 
   #For proper WSF interaction of received DIS entities from other networked simulations, 
   #a corresponding simple platform_type must be created with defined signatures.
   #Ex:
   entity_type BOMBER              1:1:200:1:1:1:0 
   entity_type COMMAND             1:1:200:2:2:2:0 
   entity_type FIGHTER             1:1:200:3:3:3:0 
   entity_type SAM_LAUNCHER        1:1:200:4:4:4:0
   entity_type SENSOR_DRONE        1:1:200:5:5:5:0
   entity_type AAM_BASE            1:1:200:6:6:6:0
   entity_type AGM                 1:1:200:7:7:7:0
   entity_type ATG                 1:1:200:8:8:8:0

   #application <ignore_type <dis_entity_type>
   #Specify the DIS application ID in the range [1, 65534]. Each scenario will need to overide this interface and 
   #have a unique application number. see red_team.txt
   #Ex:
   application 11
   
   #site <dis-site-id>
   #Specify the DIS site ID in the range [1, 65534].
   site 22
